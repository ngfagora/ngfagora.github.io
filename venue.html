		    to board the flight bound for the Republic of Korea.  
		    K-ETA is an electronic travel authorization that visa-free foreign visitors (from ~100 countries) must apply online 
		    at least 72 hours before boarding the flight, and get approved ahead of their travel.  
		    In most cases, applicants can find out the results within 48 hours after completing the K-ETA application; 
		    however, in some case the process may take 72 hours or more.  So, please apply for K-ETA with sufficient time left. 
		    The applicaiton fee is 10,000 won (KRW; 1 USD ~ 1,350 KRW).

	    	    Please direct any questions regarding the entry to Korea to your nearest Korean Embassy or Consulate, 
		    as the terms and conditions may vary by country.
		    In case a participant needs an official invitation letter for a visa, the LOC will try to work with the University to provide one,

    <h4>From Airport to Hoam Faculty House At SNU</h4>
	<ul>
	    <div class="image">
		<a href="{{ '/assets/img/limousine_map.png' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">
		    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/limousine_map.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Bus Map"  style="margin-left: 20px;" style="margin-top: 10px;">
		</a>
            </div>
	    <li>Once you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do" target="_blank">Incheon International Airport</a> (ICN), 
		the limousine bus is probably the most convenient and inexpensive way to get to the SNU Gwanak campus. 
	    An <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=51" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6017)</a> 
		    travels from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House 
		    in about 80 minutes in normal traffic (if boarding at Terminal 1, Boarding Stop 6), or 100 minutes (if boarding at Terminal 2, Boarding Stop 27). 
	    Note that the Hoam Faculty House is the last stop of this bus, whose fare is 17,000 won (KRW, as of Jan. 2024; 1 USD ~ 1,350 KRW).  
	    Another bus (number 6003) also goes to the SNU main gate, but not only is this gate quite far from the Hoam Faculty House, 
		but the trip also takes longer, so, we do not recommend it. 
	    Limousine bus service runs every day, with no extra charge for baggages 
	    <a href="https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/tpt/busRouteList.do" target="_blank">(ICN bus routes & where to board)</a>.
	    More information can be found in the <a href="https://hoam.snu.ac.kr/%ec%b0%be%ec%95%84%ec%98%a4%ec%8b%9c%eb%8a%94%ea%b8%b8/" target="_blank">website (Korean)</a>
		    of the Hoam Faculty House.</li>
	    <div class="image">
		<a href="{{ '/assets/img/taxi.png' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">
		    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/taxi.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Taxi"  style="margin-left: 20px;">
		</a>
            </div>		
	    <li>The taxi fare from ICN to the Hoam Faculty House is around 70,000 won (KRW) depending on traffic conditions.
		For a deluxe taxi (<a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=140661&menuSn=477" target="_blank">Mobeom Taxi</a>), 
		    the approximate fare will be around 90,000 won (KRW).
	    	If you get on a taxi, show the first sentence in the image on the right to the driver.
	    	All taxis in Korea -- and nearly all stores/restaurants/hotels -- accept credit cards, but prepare some cash in KRW 
	    		in case your credit card doesn't work.  Tips are not necessary as there is no tipping culture in Korea.</li>
	    <li>If you arrive at the <a href="https://www.airport.co.kr/gimpoeng/index.do" target="_blank">Gimpo International Airport</a> (GMP), 
		an <a href="https://airportlimousine.co.kr/en/sub/sub01.php?cat_no=9" target="_blank">Airport Limousine Bus (number 6003)</a> is the only limousine option (boarding at Gate 12), and it will take you to the SNU main gate.  
		    You will likely have to take a taxi or a campus shuttle there to the Hoam Faculty House.</li>

	    		<li>Take the No. 02 bus at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PkRAoizvuBqeNj9t7" target="_blank">Hoam Faculty House stop</a>. Be cautious that the bus stop is across the road from the Hoam Faculty House since the other bus would go to the opposite direction. </li>
	    		<li>Get off the bus at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JxuBiPWUduyzRM938" target="_blank"> Outdoor Auditorium stop</a>.</li>
			<li>Walk to the Sangsan Math Science Building following the direction illustrated in the image on the right.</li>
			<li>NOTE I: You may walk from the Hoam Faculty House to the Outdoor Auditorium following the bus route, although it involves a gentle incline.  
				In this case, the entire trip will take about 30-35 minutes.</li>
			<li>NOTE II: You may take a free shuttle bus running around the campus.  To get on <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/about/campus/gwanak/shuttles">this bus</a> (counterclockwise), you will first need to walk to the <a href = "https://maps.app.goo.gl/UWcEjYMumLcNQSKi6" target="_blank">Gwanaksa Samgeori stop</a>.
				The bus will take you to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNUQUqQtJdwh86Gz7" target="_blank">College of Agriculture and Life Sciences stop</a> which is right across the Sangsan Math Science Building.
				Alternatively, another shuttle bus (<a href="https://www.snu.ac.kr/about/gwanak/shuttles/shuttle_stops" target="_blank">역순환셔틀</a>; clockwise) departing in front of the Hoam Faculty House will take you to the Gwanak Samgeori and then eventually to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNUQUqQtJdwh86Gz7" target="_blank">College of Agriculture and Life Sciences stop</a>. 
				But this bus does not run as often as the other bus, and it does not have any announcement nor a buzzer to signal the driver.  You may show the image on the right to the driver before the bus departs.</li>

	    <li>The two nearest subway stations around the SNU Gwanak campus are 
		    the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YubjA2cQ5n7hmi7Y7" target="_blank">Seoul National Univ. (Gwanak-gu Office) station</a> 
		    and the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ipKD1kJB6Eo7QvUR7" target="_blank">Nakseongdae station</a>, both on Subway Line No. 2 (the "Green Line").
	    	The former is located 30-40 minutes walk from the SNU main gate, 
		    and the latter is 20 minutes walk from the SNU rear gate that is close to the Hoam Faculty House. 
	    	You may instead take a bus or a campus shuttle to and from these two subway stations to explore Seoul. </li>

    <h4>Recommended Restaurants Near Hoam Faculty House</h4>
	<div>
	<ul>
	    <li> There are several good restaurants around the SNU campus, but, here we list restaurants specifically for foreign visitors who are looking for familiar foods, 
		    and the ones where you can use English to order dishes.  Before you visit them, please make sure that they are open by checking Google Maps information.
	    <li> First of all, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2c8mckWVKiRm8RTT7" target="_blank">The Melting Pot</a> is known as one of the best burger restaurants in Korea, and well-known to SNU students.
	    	    It will be fun to compare this store to the best burger restaurant you know.  In a popular Moroccan restaurant nearby, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PKA3rMUu6hKjn9SKA" target="_blank">Nangman Morocco</a>, 
		    we recommend the combination of Tajine and khobz. Also, the brisket spinach oil linguine is very popular. </li>
	    <li> If you are a big fan of Mexican food, you may want to visit <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tHRytvwKfqEydwKt8" target="_blank">Publico taco</a>.  They serve various tacos and Quesadillas. 
		    But beware that you may need to ask them to remove the coriander topping if you do not prefer it! <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/v6zQ5TD5B7bizL2c9" target="_blank">El Tapeo</a> is a Spanish restaurant with good reputation.  
		    The foods are well paired with wine or beer.  Lastly, if you want to have a simple and convenient meal, there is a sandwich shop <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PaMABdtNkDDgHhLJA" target="_blank">Quiznos</a> on campus, close to the Hoam Faculty House.</li>
